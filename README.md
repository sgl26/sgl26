Hi, I’m @sgl26 (Sam Lawton)
I'm currently a University of Bath student studying Intergrated Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (IMEE for short)
- I’m currently a beginner and am interested in improving my profile on GitHub
- I have learned C++, Arduino, Matlab, Python and C and am looking to add Java and C# to this. 
- I’m looking to collaborate on any project I can get my hands on. Like I said I am fairly new to this, but want to learn in any way I can.
- reach me through my email (on my profile)
